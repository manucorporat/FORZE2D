 * This feature is still experimental, but several tests show that it works properly.
 * @warning take care using your own opengl code if this setting is enabled.

 To enable set it to a value different than 0. Enabled by default.

 Use GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP instead of GL_TRIANGLES when rendering the texture atlas.

 - They can't have mipmaps
 - They only accept GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE in GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_{S,T}
